## 1. Introduction

This project aims to analyze production and purchasing efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and improve overall supply chain and operational efficiency for Adventure Works.

- **Tools Used:**
    - **SQL Server:** For data extraction and joining multiple tables
    - **Power BI:** For data analysis, building the data model, creating relationships, and generating insights.
    - **Excel:** For initial data exploration, anomaly detection, and data quality checks.

      
- **Key Objectives:**
    - Analyze production performance and identify delays.
    - Track purchasing and order processes for improvement.
    - Develop insights to enhance production planning and operational efficiency.
       
- **Data Source:** [AdventureWorks Database](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorks2019.bak)

## 2. AdventureWorks Dataset Overview

AdventureWorks is a comprehensive dataset for a fictional company manufacturing bicycles and related products. Our project focuses on the **Production** and **Purchasing** schemas, covering production workflows, components, orders, and procurement.

## 3. Data Exploration & Transformation with SQL

- **Exploration:**
Data was extracted from the **AdventureWorks** database using SQL queries to target key tables within multiple schemas, primarily **Production** and **Purchasing**. Over **30 tables** were integrated across these schemas through SQL queries, producing **six key tables** used for the analysis.

- **Schemas Used:** Production, Purchasing

- **Transformation Process:**
Multiple SQL queries were designed to integrate data from various tables, creating a unified dataset for deeper analysis in Power BI. Below is a summary of each query used in the process:

 - **Query 1:** Production and Work Order Data Extraction
