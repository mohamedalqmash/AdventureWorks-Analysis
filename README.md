- **Data Source:** [AdventureWorks Database](https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/download/adventureworks/AdventureWorks2019.bak)

## 2. AdventureWorks Dataset Overview

AdventureWorks is a comprehensive dataset for a fictional company manufacturing bicycles and related products. Our project focuses on the **Production** and **Purchasing** schemas, covering production workflows, components, orders, and procurement.

## 3. Data Exploration & Transformation with SQL

- **Exploration:**
Data was extracted from the **AdventureWorks** database using SQL queries to target key tables within multiple schemas, primarily **Production** and **Purchasing**. Over **30 tables** were integrated across these schemas through SQL queries, producing **six key tables** used for the analysis.

- **Schemas Used:** Production, Purchasing

- **Transformation Process:**
Multiple SQL queries were designed to integrate data from various tables, creating a unified dataset for deeper analysis in Power BI. Below is a summary of each query used in the process:

## 4-Data Cleaning

Data cleaning was conducted using SQL and Excel, focusing on:

- **Detecting and removing anomalies to improve data quality.**
- **Retaining Null values where they signify meaningful missing information, which was relevant for analysis purposes.**

## 5-Data Modeling

Data modeling was conducted in Power BI, establishing relationships between tables to ensure data integrity and enable comprehensive analysis:

- **Primary Relationships:** Key relationships were created between tables by mapping primary keys and foreign keys, allowing coherent navigation across production and purchasing data.

- **Broken Relationships:** During model construction, certain relationships required adjustments to ensure compatibility. This was achieved through remapping and restructuring fields as needed.

- **Schema Focus:** The model includes selected tables from the Production and Purchasing schemas only, aligned with the projectâ€™s goals by focusing on relevant data for effective analysis.

- **Data Integration:** Relationships were carefully adjusted to maintain compatibility, and fields were remapped where necessary to facilitate seamless navigation across tables such as Procurement and Shipping, Product Components, and Work Order Performance.

## 6. Data Analysis & Insights
Key insights from the data analysis include:

- **Shipping Performance by Carrier:** Examines costs by carrier before and after taxes.
- **Ratio of Finished Goods:** Calculates finished goods versus in-progress goods.
- **Scrap Rates for Products:** Identifies products with high scrap quantities.
- **Shipping Delays:** Highlights products causing significant shipping delays.
- **Final Price per Unit:** Evaluates costs across product categories after taxes.
- **In-house vs. External Production:** Assesses the balance of in-house and externally purchased products.
- **Top Vendors:** Lists top vendors by supply quantities.

## 7. Dashboard Overview
The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive visual overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) related to production, purchasing, shipping, and work orders. This primary dashboard summarizes the most critical KPIs from the six tables used in the analysis.

- **Procurement and Shipping Performance:** Provides insights into carrier performance and cost efficiency.
  
- **Product Overview:** Offers a breakdown of product metrics, costs, and category distributions.
  
- **Production Efficiency:** Highlights key metrics for operational efficiency, including resource utilization and delays.
  
- **Product Components and Assembly:** Examines component utilization, assembly efficiency, and in-house versus external sourcing.
  
Each dashboard in the PDF focuses on a different aspect of operational performance, providing deeper insights to support strategic decision-making.

## 8. Challenges Faced
Key challenges during the project included:

- **Data Cleaning:** Managing outliers and inconsistencies in shipping and production data.

- **Integration in Power BI:** Broken links during data modeling required significant adjustments.

## 9. Future Work
For future improvements:

- **Enhanced Analysis:** Explore machine learning for predictive insights.
- **Optimization:** Use more advanced statistical methods to enhance accuracy in production forecasts.
- **Expanded Data Integration:** Integrate additional schemas for a more comprehensive analysis.

## 10. Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following steps are suggested:

- **Reduce Scrap Rates:** Investigate high scrap products and implement quality control measures.
- **Optimize Shipping:** Reevaluate carrier contracts to lower costs.
- **Security Enhancement:** Implement stronger measures to reduce inventory theft.

## 11. Conclusion
The project uncovered valuable insights into production inefficiencies and potential cost-saving opportunities. Enhancing data-driven strategies could improve Adventure Works' operational efficiency and streamline production.
